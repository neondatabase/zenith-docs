# Introduction

### What is Zenith?

Zenith is a serverless implementation of PostgreSQL

### What does Zenith do?

Zenith's main features are:
* serverless postgreSQL: explain serverless
* data branching: explain data branching
* data push/pull (I think there needs to be a strong use case for this to be included, I still need to dig in on this use case)

### What do I use Zenith for?

TODO

* I think we should mention something about Zenith as a replacement for anywhere postgreSQL is used (if this is true).
* I think we should mention CI/CD

### How do I start using Zenith?

TODO

* metion web console. link to web console tutorial.
* mention desktop demo (aka local installation). link to local installation tutorial.
